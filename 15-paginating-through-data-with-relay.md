> This exercise is challenging and asks for paging backwards as well as forwards.

I'm assuming you have a server that can paginate over, say, `Person` objects. If you don't, feel free to pull or clone <https://github.com/petermunro/relay-starter-kit>.

In Relay, show a list of 10 `Person`s, with "First", "Previous 10", "Next 10" and "Last 10" buttons, allowing you to view each page in turn.

To see how to use query variables, examine the example _A simple parameterization_ at <https://facebook.github.io/relay/>.
